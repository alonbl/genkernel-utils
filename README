Gentoo's genkernel is a wonderful tool that ease kernel compilation process.
This tool can be extended in order to provide the following features: 

1. Replace the default linuxrc with the one provided here, in order to support suspend2,
   disk encryption and PKCS#11. 
2. Add required files to initramfs in order to support suspend2, disk encryption and
   optionally PKCS#11. 
3. Handle remerge of kernel depended modules when a new kernel is configured. 
4. Support two versions of the same kernel (Debug and production), in order to not lock
   computer when invalid kernel is installed. 
5. Don't install kernel symbol file in order to make it harder to reverse debug the bzImage. 

genkernels-utils configuration
==============================
Setup /etc/mygenkernel.conf (Example provided).

Kernel configuration
=====================
Kernel should be located at /etc/kernels/kernel-config-<arch>-<kernel name>
	This is a standard genkernel configuration.

linuxrc should be located at /var/lib/genkernel-utils/files/<kernel name> (Example provided).
	This is the linuxrc that will be available in the initramfs.

create-initramfs should be located at /var/lib/genkernel-utils/files/<kernel name> (Example provided).
	This script add extra files to the initramfs.

misc initramfs files may be located at /var/lib/genkernel-utils/files/<kernel name>/initramfs/%%ARCH%%

Usage
=========

mygenkernel
------------

usage: mygenkernel [--prod] [--ramdisk] [--modules] [--clean] [--no-install]
--stable        - compile stable kernel
--ramdisk        - compile only ramdisk requirements
--modules       - compile all modules not required by ramdisk
--clean         - perform clean before compilation
--no-install    - don't install result kernel

This is the main interface.

Build a complete kernel:
# mygenkernel --modules

Build a kernel without extra modules (ebuilds)
# mygenkernel

mygenkernel-commit
-------------------

Commit nonestable kernel into stable.
Copy /etc/kernels/[nonestable] to /etc/kernels/[stable]
Copy /var/lib/genkernel-utils/files/[nonestable] to /etc/lib/genkernel-utils/files/[stable]
mygenkernel --stable --modules
mygenkernel --no-install

The last is required so that the kernel tree will always be available for nonestable tests.
